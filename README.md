# About the Project

## Project Goal

###  Your readme should include a clear project goal that reflect on what you are trying to achieve for the business/organization (in the scenario layed out). Your goal is never just to create an algorithm or model or to purely make discoveries in exploration...it includes the why. "My goal is to..., so that..." Your goal should be specific enough to know when you have reached it and concise enough to keep in 1-2 sentences. "My goal is to identify key drivers of churn, which customers at risk of churn, and make recommendations for changes so that we can reduce the monthly churn rate and increase customer retention." This helps tell you when you have reached a minimally viable product (including a presentation and predictions, in this example scenario).

### For example:

### The goal of this project is to identifty the attributes of passengers who survived the Titanic shipwreck in order to make receommendations of the best way to travel on a ship to maximize chance of survival should the ship run into a devastating end.

## Project Description

### Your readme should include a project description that provides context for your project, including explaining why you are tackling this project, why it is important and how it could be of use to someone else beyond just the interest or new knowledge. It dives in a bit deeper than the goals. Project description and goals should always be in your words and specific to your project, not a copy of the class project spec. Here's the problem, here's how I want to address it, here's what I will deliver.

### For example:

### The weather is getting more and more extreme and unpredictable. We often think of the Titanic is something in the past that won't happen again. However, these events could become more frequent with the change in the oceanic warming and atmospheric changes. We will analyze the attributes of passengers who were more or less likely to survive, develop a model for predicting survival based on those attributes, and leave with both recommendations for future passengers and predictions of survival for a list of passengers on the next ship leaving (delivered via csv).

## Initial Questions

### Your readme should include initial questions and focus you are going into the analysis with. This is an important part of project planning and gives context to the reader about where you started, what were your initial ideas and thoughts, and did those play out to be true.

### For example:

### Was the phrase "women and children first" just a myth or did they really try to get out women and children first? If so, they would show as more likely to survive.

### Do those who travel first class get quicker access to life boats?

### Do families with small children get priority access? Even if they at the bottom of the boat in 3rd class?


## Data Dictionary 

### Your readme should include a data dictionary, which is important to provide in order to define and disambiguate each of the variables you are analyzing.

### Insert dataframe of data dictionary

## Steps to Reproduce 

### Your readme should include useful and adequate instructions for reproducing your analysis and final report.

### For example:

### 1. You will need an env.py file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the titanic_db.passengers table. Store that env file locally in the repository.
### 2. Clone my repo (including the acquireTitanic.py and prepare.Titanic.py) (confirm .gitignore is hiding your env.py file)
### 3. Libraries used are pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn.
### 4. You should be able to run survival_report.

## The Plan

### Wrangle

#### Modules (acquire.py + prepare.py)

#### 1. Module(s) with user-defined functions for acquiring and preparing the data should be created.

#### 2. Each function contains a helpful docstring explaining what it does, its input(s) and output(s).

#### 3. Credentials (such as in an env.py file) are NOT included in the public repo.
